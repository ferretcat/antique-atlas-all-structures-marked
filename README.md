## Modified Version

This is a fork of the Antique Atlas 4 mod for 1.21 published by @sisby-folk. I wanted all structures to be marked and found no mod for this, so I tried coding it myself. I can code a very little bit java but have never read or seen anything related to minecraft coding. That's why 1) this is a fork and no additional mod and 2) the code I added is probably awful :-) But it works. Structures are marked with the point texture and are not deletable.
